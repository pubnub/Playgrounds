# Playgrounds
This project uses Playgrounds to show the features of the [PubNub Swift SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/swift/pubnub-swift-sdk) with Apple's Playgrounds, such as their [Learn the Essentials of Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH3-SW1)
